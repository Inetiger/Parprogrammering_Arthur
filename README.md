# Parprogrammering_Arthur

This was When i had PartnerProgramming with our dear boy Arthur,
he was genuinely one good guy, he was awsome to talk to and
had lots to say when it came to programming.

## What did we do?

Well we embarked on two tasks the first was quite simple,
we were suppose to make a script for you to write
your name, age, hair color, about you and what kind of
hobbies you interacted with in recent times. you could
make multiple persons then wirte information about
the ones you want.

# The second

The second task was a bit more complex task but still
done long before our time was done. It ressembles
a site like IMBD, where you have lots of movies
and you can find all kind of information on the choosen
movie. So you can add movies you want, and see the full
list of movies and see information on that movie.
Much the same as the first tast.
